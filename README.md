# TOP - Memory Card

This project is intended to practice functional components and hooks instead of class components

It's a memory game with images of characters fetched using [The Rick and Morty API](https://rickandmortyapi.com/).

`React-query` was used to manage the API call.

You can check it live and play in [this link](http://rolckeirnad.github.io/TOP-memory-game)
